Info for site, you can delete this when done: we don't have the images or wireframe so it
is very open ended on design, we can just use temp images of whatever since we don't have the actual images.

2. OSPFv2 Configuration – Configured a point-to-point single-area OSPFv2 network.
3. Cybersecurity Challenge – Used Kali Linux to extract and crack Windows passwords in a lab environment.
